% I. initialize positions and velocities of particles 

% II. Evaluate each particle in the swarm, compute f(x_i) where x_i is the
% position of the i-th particle

% III. Update the best position of each particle and the global best position 


% IV. Update particle velocities and positions, restrict velocities 
% and remember intertia weight. 


% V. if termination condition has been reached, quit, else return to step II
